Abstract
With the increasing volume of student queries in educational institutions, manual classification and resolution can be time-consuming. This study proposes a machine learning-based classification system using TF-IDF and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to automatically categorize student queries into relevant departments. The approach enables faster query resolution, improving response efficiency for both students and administrators.

Key Highlights
‚úÖ Automated query classification using TF-IDF and SVM
‚úÖ Data preprocessing & text vectorization for high accuracy classification
‚úÖ End-to-end pipeline for receiving, categorizing, and resolving queries
‚úÖ Achieved 89% classification accuracy, reducing response time significantly

Technologies Used
Machine Learning Algorithms: TF-IDF, SVM, Logistic Regression
Programming Languages: Python
Data Processing: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Vectorization
Tools & Frameworks: Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn
