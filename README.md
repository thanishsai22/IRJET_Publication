## **Abstract**  
With the increasing volume of student queries in educational institutions, manual classification and resolution can be time-consuming. This study proposes a **machine learning-based classification system** using **TF-IDF and Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to automatically categorize student queries into relevant departments. The approach enables **faster query resolution**, improving response efficiency for both students and administrators.

## **Key Highlights**  
‚úÖ **Automated query classification** using **TF-IDF** and **SVM**  
‚úÖ **Data preprocessing & text vectorization** for high accuracy classification  
‚úÖ **End-to-end pipeline** for receiving, categorizing, and resolving queries  
‚úÖ **Achieved 89% classification accuracy**, reducing response time significantly
